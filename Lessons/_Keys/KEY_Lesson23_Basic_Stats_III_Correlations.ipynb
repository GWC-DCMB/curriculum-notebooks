    "A **correlation** is a measure of the statistical relationship between two variables. Correlation values range from -1 to 1, where the *magnitude* (a.k.a. absolute value) of the correlation indicates the strength of the relationship and the *sign* of the correlation represents the direction of the relationship. The correlation value is often denoted with the variable **r**, so that is what we will use here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows some examples of *perfect*, *strong* and *weak* correlations between two variables in both the positive and negative directions. As you can notice, *perfect* correlation between two variables corresponds to **|r| = 1**. Stronger correlations have r values with magnitude closer to 1, and weaker correlations have r values with magnitude closer to 0. When r = 0, there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
