# Setup

Welcome to Girls Who Code! We're so excited you're here.

Throughout the club, we will be writing Python code with Google Colab. 
Colab lets us run our code online so we don't have to install anything on our computers. 
Follow the instructions below to get started.

1. Go to Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com

1. Bookmark it.

1. You should see a screen with a search box like this:  

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/master/Figures/01colab.png" style="width: 500px;"/>

1. Click on the GitHub tab.

1. Search for `GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum` and click on the file `Practices/Practice01_Jupyter-Setup.ipynb`.

1. When the notebook loads, you should see something like this:

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum/master/Figures/03notebook.png" style="width: 500px;"/>

1. Press the button `Copy to Drive` so you can save your work.

Congrats, you're ready to start coding!

Some notes:
- Whenever you want to open a new notebook, you can click `File` > `Open Notebook` and search for the file from GitHub in `GWC-DCMB/ClubCurriculum`.
- Alternatively, you can open a blank notebook by clicking `File` > `New Python 3 notebook`. 
- Be sure to save your work to Drive!
- If you want to open a notebook you have already saved to Drive, go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and open the folder `Colab Notebooks`. It should be in there!
