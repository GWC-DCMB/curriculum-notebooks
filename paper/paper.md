# Summary

<!-- pasted from our PyCon 2020 talk proposal -->
We are Bioinformatics PhD students at the University of Michigan who started a
local chapter of Girls Who Code to provide a fun and supportive environment for
high school women to learn the power of coding. Our goal was to cover basic
coding topics and data science concepts through live-coding and hands-on
practice. However, we couldnâ€™t find a resource that exactly met our needs. Over
the past three years, we have developed a curriculum and instructional format
using Jupyter notebooks to effectively teach introductory Python for data
science. This method, inspired by The Carpentries organization
[@wilson_software_2016], uses bite-sized lessons followed by independent
practice time to reinforce coding concepts, and culminates in a data science
capstone project using real-world data. We believe our open curriculum is a
valuable resource to the wider education community and hope that educators will
use and improve our lessons, challenge problems, and teaching best-practices.
Anyone can contribute to our educational materials on GitHub
(https://github.com/GWC-DCMB).


# Statement of Need

TODO: we had been using data camp, it was okay but didn't meet our needs, so we
developed our own curriculum to teach intro python for data science via live
coding with jupyter notebooks [@kluyver_jupyter_2016].

# Collaborative Curriculum Development

We assembled a team of volunteers involved in our club to develop a custom
curriculum to teach introductory Python for data science via live coding.
We chose what content to cover based on what our students would need to learn in
order to complete a small data analysis project and communicate their findings
to their peers.
We divided up the content by topic into Jupyter notebooks for each lesson, with
each lesson taking approximately 15-20 minutes to teach via live coding.
Each lesson has a corresponding practice notebook with additional exercises on
the same content taught in the lesson, but with different data or variables
used.
We hosted the curriculum notebooks in a public GitHub repository to facilitate
collaborative development and peer review using pull requests.
In the initial curriculum drafting phase, developers were assigned lesson and
practice notebooks to write.
Once the draft of a lesson was completed, the writer opened a pull request and
asked for review from a different developer.
The reviewer then provided feedback and approved the pull request to be merged
into the main branch after the writer made any requested changes.
This way, more than one person viewed each notebook before it could be
incorporated into the public curriculum, which reduced mistakes and ensured
higher quality content. <!-- TODO: cite U-M Carpentries paper for the development model once it's submitted to bioRxiv?-->
While teaching from the curriculum at the first Data Science Summer Experience,
instructors took notes on their experience and fixed any problems afterward.
Maintainers continue to monitor the repository and resolve issues as they arise.

Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly pivoted our club to a
virtual format.
In preparation for the 2020 Summer Experience, we switched to a flipped
classroom style following feedback from our club participants that it was too
difficult to follow along live coding via Zoom.
We recorded facilitators teaching the lesson notebooks as if they were live
coding, then shared them along with a link to the lesson notebooks for students
to code along with while watching the videos.
Each video shows the Jupyter notebook alongside the facilitator themselves
teaching.
This format allowed students to learn at their own pace, then ask questions and
practice when we met together virtually. <!-- TODO: should this actually go later in the curriculum section?-->

Our Jupyter notebooks and links to the lesson videos can be accessed on GitHub:
