# Summary

<!-- pasted from our PyCon 2020 talk proposal -->
We are Bioinformatics PhD students at the University of Michigan who started a
local chapter of Girls Who Code to provide a fun and supportive environment for
high school women to learn the power of coding. Our goal was to cover basic
coding topics and data science concepts through live-coding and hands-on
practice. However, we couldn’t find a resource that exactly met our needs. Over
the past three years, we have developed a curriculum and instructional format
using Jupyter notebooks to effectively teach introductory Python for data
science. This method, inspired by The Carpentries organization
[@wilson_software_2016], uses bite-sized lessons followed by independent
practice time to reinforce coding concepts, and culminates in a data science
capstone project using real-world data. We believe our open curriculum is a
valuable resource to the wider education community and hope that educators will
use and improve our lessons, challenge problems, and teaching best-practices.
Anyone can contribute to our educational materials on GitHub

# Statement of Need

As women in the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, we experience the gender gap in our field first hand. XX% of doctoral students in our department are women and XX% of DCMB affiliated faculty are women. Previous research has shown that women leave computer science and related majors during their undergraduate careers because they feel less prepared than the men in their cohort (REF). The majority of the Club’s founders began coding in our undergraduate careers or later. We wanted to provide a safe place for local young women to begin coding in high school, and develop confidence in themselves and their computational skills before college. A national organization whose mission and values aligned with ours was founded in 2012. Girls Who Code’s mission is to close the gender gap in technology (https://girlswhocode.com/2015report/). In 2017 we began a student organization at the University of Michigan, and for the past four academic years we have registered annually as a recognized Girls Who Code Club because the national organization provided name recognition, curriculum resources, guidance for a capstone Impact Project, and a framework for launching a Club. In 2019 we launched a Data Science Summer Experience which is unaffiliated with the national Girls Who Code organization.

The national Girls Who Code organization provides a curriculum that teaches website and application development through programming languages like HTML and Java. However, our graduate students generally have limited experience with these languages. Data Scientist was rated the #1 job in America by Glassdoor in 2016-2019, the #3 in 2020, and #2 in 2021 (https://www.glassdoor.com/research/best-jobs-2019/#). specialized curriculum focused on computational data science in the Python programming language. We believe career exploration in data science will optimally prepare our students for careers that provide financial stability. By leveraging the data science expertise of our Club facilitators, we created a specialized curriculum focused on computational data science in the Python programming language.

Girls Who Code encourages participants to learn programming skills while working on an Impact Project website or application throughout the Club (https://hq.girlswhocode.com/project-gallery?). We created an open source Data Science curriculum that teaches the requisite Python and statistics skills to complete a Capstone Project, which is a data analysis project on a data set of interest. Using this curriculum, we employ participatory live coding as used by The Carpentries (pmid:24715981) which is an effective method that engages learners (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090). With paired activities our curriculum follows the “I do, we do, you do” didactic paradigm (Fisher D, Frey N. Better Learning Through Structured Teaching: A Framework for the Gradual Release of Responsibility. ASCD; 2013.).

# Collaborative Curriculum Development

We assembled a team of volunteers involved in our club to develop a custom
curriculum to teach introductory Python for data science via live coding.
We chose what content to cover based on what our students would need to learn in
order to complete a small data analysis project and communicate their findings
to their peers.
We divided up the content by topic into Jupyter notebooks for each lesson, with
each lesson taking approximately 15-20 minutes to teach via live coding.
Each lesson has a corresponding practice notebook with additional exercises on
the same content taught in the lesson, but with different data or variables
used.
We hosted the curriculum notebooks in a public GitHub repository to facilitate
collaborative development and peer review using pull requests.
In the initial curriculum drafting phase, developers were assigned lesson and
practice notebooks to write.
Once the draft of a lesson was completed, the writer opened a pull request and
asked for review from a different developer.
The reviewer then provided feedback and approved the pull request to be merged
into the main branch after the writer made any requested changes.
This way, more than one person viewed each notebook before it could be
incorporated into the public curriculum, which reduced mistakes and ensured
higher quality content. <!-- TODO: cite U-M Carpentries paper for the development model once it's submitted to bioRxiv?-->
While teaching from the curriculum at the first Data Science Summer Experience,
instructors took notes on their experience and fixed any problems afterward.
Maintainers continue to monitor the repository and resolve issues as they arise.
