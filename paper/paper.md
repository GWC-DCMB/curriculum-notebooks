# Summary

<!-- pasted from our PyCon 2020 talk proposal -->
We are Bioinformatics PhD students at the University of Michigan who started a
local chapter of Girls Who Code to provide a fun and supportive environment for
high school women to learn the power of coding. Our goal was to cover basic
coding topics and data science concepts through live-coding and hands-on
practice. However, we couldnâ€™t find a resource that exactly met our needs. Over
the past three years, we have developed a curriculum and instructional format
using Jupyter notebooks to effectively teach introductory Python for data
science. This method, inspired by The Carpentries organization
[@wilson_software_2016], uses bite-sized lessons followed by independent
practice time to reinforce coding concepts, and culminates in a data science
capstone project using real-world data. We believe our open curriculum is a
valuable resource to the wider education community and hope that educators will
use and improve our lessons, challenge problems, and teaching best-practices.
Anyone can contribute to our educational materials on GitHub
(https://github.com/GWC-DCMB).


# Statement of Need

TODO: we had been using data camp, it was okay but didn't meet our needs, so we
developed our own curriculum to teach intro python for data science via live
coding with jupyter notebooks [@kluyver_jupyter_2016].
